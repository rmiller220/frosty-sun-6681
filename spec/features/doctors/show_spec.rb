User Story 1, Doctors Show Page

As a visitor
When I visit a doctor's show page
I see all of that doctor's information including:
 - name
 - specialty
 - university where they got their doctorate
And I see the name of the hospital where this doctor works
And I see the names of all of the patients this doctor has
